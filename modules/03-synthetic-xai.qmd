# Emerging Data Science in Government: Synthetic Data and Explainable AI


## Synthetic Data: Definition & Terminology

**Context:**  
Synthetic tabular data generation learns the joint distribution of mixed continuous and discrete features and produces a synthetic table `T_synth` that retains the statistical properties of the original dataset. Modern **generative AI models** capture complex dependencies and enable realistic, high-utility synthetic datasets [@raghunathan2021synthetic; @feuerriegel2024generative].

- Artificially generated data mimicking real datasets [@raghunathan2021synthetic].  
- Maintains statistical properties without exposing sensitive information.  
- Key concepts [@van2023synthetic]:  
  - **Fidelity**: how closely synthetic data matches real data  
  - **Privacy-preserving**: avoids revealing real individuals  
  - **Utility**: usefulness for analytics and model training

## Synthetic Data: Challenges & Motivation
Real data often limited in **quantity**, **quality**, and **availability**.

## Synthetic Data: Evolution of TDS Methods

- Driven by **data complexity**, **computing advances**, and **privacy needs**.  
- Early phase: **sampling methods** to improve balance and efficiency.  
- Foundations: **statistical models** (imputation, probabilistic approaches).  
- Transition: **shallow DGMs** using MLPs → start of neural synthesis.  
- Modern era: **diffusion models** and **LLMs** → higher fidelity and flexibility.

## Synthetic Data: Value & Applications

- **Safe data sharing** across agencies and research sectors.  
- Addresses **data scarcity**, especially for small or minority groups.  
- Enhances **model development**, robustness, and system testing.  
- Supports **policy evaluation** and cross-sector innovation.  
- **Health**: simulate patient records for modelling and risk analysis.  
- **Social policy**: test interventions without exposing individuals.  
- **Urban planning**: generate census/traffic scenarios for planning.  
- **Finance**: create synthetic transactions for safe anomaly detection.

## Explainable AI (XAI): Definition & Terminology
- Techniques that provide **insight into how ML models make decisions**.  
- Key terms:  
  - **Transparency**: model decisions are understandable  
  - **Interpretability**: features driving predictions are explainable  
  - **Accountability**: ensures ethical and responsible AI use  

---

## XAI: Challenges & Motivation
- ML adoption requires both accuracy and interpretability.
- Model Accurarcy vs. Interpretability trade-off.

## XAI: Latest Methods & Models
- Intrinsic Interpretability: simple models (e.g. LR, DT) [@ai2021model].
- Post-hoc Explanations for complex models:
  - **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: quantifies feature contributions.  
  - **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: local surrogate models for predictions.
  - Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs): Show how changes in one feature affect predictions while averaging over others.

- Correlation vs. Causation: association <> causal impact: **Counterfactual explanations**: show what minimal changes alter predictions [@altman2015points].
- Model-specific interpretable architectures (e.g., attention-based models).
