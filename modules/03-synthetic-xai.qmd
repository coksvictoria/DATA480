# Emerging Data Science in Government: Synthetic Data and Explainable AI


## Synthetic Data: Definition & Terminology
- Artificially generated data mimicking real datasets.  
- Maintains statistical properties without exposing sensitive information.  
- Key concepts:  
  - **Fidelity**: how closely synthetic data matches real data  
  - **Privacy-preserving**: avoids revealing real individuals  
  - **Utility**: usefulness for analytics and model training  

---

## Synthetic Data: Challenges & Motivation
- Real data often limited in **quantity**, **quality**, and **availability**.  
- Examples: rare diseases, small populations, restricted government datasets.  
- Traditional data-sharing is restricted due to **privacy regulations**.  
- Synthetic data addresses these challenges while enabling experimentation.

## Synthetic Data: Latest Models & Methods
- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**: generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data.  
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: model complex distributions and generate realistic synthetic samples.  
- **Privacy-enhancing methods**: differential privacy, k-anonymity for secure synthesis.  
- Tools: SDV (Synthetic Data Vault), CTGAN, SynthPop, MOSTLY AI.

## Synthetic Data: Case Studies / Applications
- Health: simulate patient records for predictive modelling.  
- Social policy: test policy interventions without exposing personal data.  
- Urban planning: simulate census/traffic data to evaluate scenarios.  
- Finance: model synthetic transactions to detect anomalies safely.  

---

## Synthetic Data: Potential Value
- Safe data sharing across agencies and with researchers.  
- Overcomes scarcity in small datasets or minority populations.  
- Improves model robustness and testing before applying on real data.  
- Accelerates research, policy evaluation, and cross-sector innovation.

## Explainable AI (XAI): Definition & Terminology
- Techniques that provide **insight into how ML models make decisions**.  
- Key terms:  
  - **Transparency**: model decisions are understandable  
  - **Interpretability**: features driving predictions are explainable  
  - **Accountability**: ensures ethical and responsible AI use  

---

## XAI: Challenges & Motivation
- Black-box models (deep learning, ensemble models) are **hard to trust**.  
- Governments require **explainable decisions** for policy, auditing, and public accountability.  
- Lack of interpretability slows ML adoption in sensitive sectors.  

---

## XAI: Latest Methods & Models
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: quantifies feature contributions.  
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: local surrogate models for predictions.  
- **Counterfactual explanations**: show what minimal changes alter predictions.  
- Model-specific interpretable architectures (e.g., attention-based models).  

---

## XAI: Case Studies / Applications
- Health: explain risk predictions for resource allocation.  
- Tax: explain anomaly detection results to auditors.  
- Social services: identify drivers of inequity transparently.  
- Policy simulations: explain ML-driven recommendations for public review.  

---

## XAI: Potential Value
- Builds **trust and confidence** among policymakers and stakeholders.  
- Facilitates **regulatory and ethical compliance** in AI deployment.  
- Enables **cross-agency ML adoption** by reducing black-box concerns.  
- Supports **responsible AI** for transparent, accountable government decision-making.
