# Research Data Landscape in New Zealand

## Research Data Repositories in Aotearoa NZ
- Students are encouraged to explore available open datasets:
  - [data.govt.nz](https://data.govt.nz): NZ Government’s open data portal  
  - [Aotearoa Data Explorer](https://statistics.govt.nz/tools/aotearoa-data-explorer): Stats NZ’s interactive tool for key social indicators  
  - [NZ Environmental Data](https://niwa.co.nz/) (NIWA, MfE, Landcare Research)  
  - [Health Sector Data](https://www.health.govt.nz/) (publications and datasets)  
  - [Education Counts](https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/) (education statistics)  
- These provide context, but our main focus will be the **IDI**.

## What is the IDI?
- **IDI = Integrated Data Infrastructure**
- A secure research database managed by Stats NZ.
- Links across domains:
  - Health  
  - Education  
  - Income and tax  
  - Benefits and social services  
  - Justice  
  - Migration and population  
- Enables longitudinal, population-wide analysis.

---

## Why the IDI is Important
- Provides a **holistic, integrated view** of New Zealand society.  
- Enables research into cross-sector issues:  
  - Health inequalities  
  - Education → employment transitions  
  - Crime, justice, and social outcomes  
- Supports **evidence-based policy** and programme evaluation.  
- Unique capability: population-level, longitudinal insights.

---

## History and Setup of the IDI
- Developed by Stats NZ, launched in **2011**.  
- Evolved from earlier data linkage prototypes.  
- Built through partnerships with government agencies.  
- Uses anonymised identifiers for secure linkage.  
- Designed to balance **data utility** and **privacy protection**.

---

## Governance and Management
- Managed by **Stats NZ** under strict frameworks.  
- Researchers require application and training for access.  
- Work is carried out in **secure Data Labs** (onsite or remote secure).  
- Core principles:  
  - Privacy and confidentiality  
  - Security by design  
  - Public good use  
- Regular audits ensure compliance.  

---

## IDI as a National Asset
- Recognised as a **world-leading integrated database**.  
- Enables **cross-sector insights** for NZ society.  
- Used by universities, government, NGOs, and international partners.  
- Facilitates research into vulnerable and minority populations.  
- Seen as a **strategic national data infrastructure**.

---

## Limitations of the IDI
- **Coverage gaps**: little to no primary care, clinical notes, or private sector data.  
- **Timeliness**: lag of 1–2 years for some datasets.  
- **Data quality**: administrative datasets not collected for research purposes.  
- **Access barriers**: approval required; access restricted to secure labs.  
- **Equity concerns**: Māori data sovereignty and representational issues.  

---

## Future Directions for the IDI
- Improve timeliness and refresh cycles.  
- Expand dataset scope: primary care, environmental, genomic data.  
- Develop **synthetic data** for broader, safe use.  
- Strengthen **Māori governance frameworks**.  
- Enhance **remote secure access** tools for researchers [@wang2024enhancing].

## Conclusion
- NZ has many research data sources; students should explore open datasets independently.  
- The **IDI is the cornerstone** of NZ’s integrated research data landscape.  
- Despite limitations, it remains a **national treasure** for research and policy.  
- Future efforts: make it **more inclusive, timely, and accessible**.
