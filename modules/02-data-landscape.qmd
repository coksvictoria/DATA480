# Research Data Landscape in New Zealand

## Research Data Repositories in Aotearoa NZ

-   Students are encouraged to explore available open datasets:
    -   [data.govt.nz](https://data.govt.nz): NZ Government’s open data portal\
    -   [Aotearoa Data Explorer](https://statistics.govt.nz/tools/aotearoa-data-explorer): Stats NZ’s interactive tool for key social indicators\
    -   [NZ Environmental Data](https://niwa.co.nz/) (NIWA, MfE, Landcare Research)\
    -   [Health Sector Data](https://www.health.govt.nz/) (publications and datasets)\
    -   [Education Counts](https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/) (education statistics)\
-   These provide context, but our main focus will be the **IDI** [@stats_nz_idi].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is the IDI (and LBD)?

Launched in **2011**, the IDI is a secure research database managed by Stats NZ that links multiple domains—including health, education, social services, justice, and migration—enabling longitudinal, population-wide analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why the IDI is Important

- Provides a **holistic, integrated view** of New Zealand society [@stats_nz_idi].  
- Enables research into cross-sector issues:  
  - Health inequalities [@milne2019data]  
  - Education → employment transitions  
  - Crime, justice, and social outcomes
- Supports **evidence-based policy** and programme evaluation [@chamberlain2022future].  
- Unique capability: population-level, longitudinal insights [@milne2022longitudinal].

- Seen as a **strategic national data infrastructure**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Governance and Management
Access to the IDI is carefully controlled, following the **Stats NZ “Five Safes” framework** [@stats_nz_idi]:  

- **Safe People** – Only trained, vetted, and approved researchers can access data. 
- **Safe Projects** –Research proposals are assessed for legality, ethics, and public benefit.
- **Safe Data** – Only de-identified or securely linked data is provided.
- **Safe Settings** – Analysis occurs in secure, isolated Data Labs with strict technical and physical controls.
- **Safe Outputs** – Results are reviewed to prevent disclosure of identifiable information.

- This framework ensures a balance between data utility and privacy protection, allowing safe, responsible use of IDI data.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limitations of the IDI

- **Access constraints**: analysis only in secure, on-site Data Labs, no offsite access [@milne2019data].

- **Computational and software limitations**: restricted processing power and limited programming languages [@choi2019adjusting].

- **Complex approval processes**: time-consuming access and release checks due to confidentiality [@milne2022longitudinal].

::: {.fragment}
-   **Coverage gaps**: little to no primary care, clinical notes, or private sector data.\
-   **Timeliness**: lag of 1–2 years for some datasets.\
-   **Data quality**: administrative datasets not collected for research purposes.\
-   **Access barriers**: approval required; access restricted to secure labs.\
-   **Equity concerns**: Māori data sovereignty and representational issues.

## Conclusion

-   NZ has many research data sources; students should explore open datasets independently [@nz_data_portals; @aotearoa_data_explorer].\
-   The **IDI is the cornerstone** of NZ’s integrated research data landscape.\
-   Despite limitations, it remains a **national treasure** for research and policy.\
-   Future efforts: make it **more inclusive, timely, and accessible**.
