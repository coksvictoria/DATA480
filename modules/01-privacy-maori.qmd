## Introduction

- Understanding privacy in New Zealand's data environment is critical for research.
- Māori data sovereignty ensures that Māori data is managed according to tikanga and principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
- Objectives for this session:
  - Review key privacy laws.
  - Introduce Māori data sovereignty concepts.
  - Discuss implications for social data research.

## Privacy Laws in Aotearoa

- **Privacy Act 2020**: Governs collection, storage, use, and sharing of personal data.
- Key principles:
  - Purpose limitation
  - Data minimization
  - Transparency and accountability
  - Individual rights to access and correction
- Enforcement through the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.

## Māori Data Sovereignty

- **Definition**: The right of Māori to control the collection, access, use, and sharing of data about Māori people, communities, and resources.
- Core principles (Te Mana Raraunga):
  - Self-determination (tino rangatiratanga)
  - Collective benefit
  - Whakapapa (contextual understanding of data)
  - Accountability and governance
- Implications:
  - Research must involve Māori governance.
  - Data sharing and usage require consent and alignment with tikanga.

## Case Study: Health Data

- Health datasets contain sensitive information:
  - National health registers
  - Hospital records
  - Pharmaceutical dispensing
- Māori communities require:
  - Governance agreements
  - Data access protocols
  - Use of synthetic data for privacy protection

---

## Discussion: Ethical Considerations

- How should researchers balance privacy, accessibility, and societal benefit?
- What processes ensure Māori data sovereignty in practice?
- Examples:
  - Collaborative data governance boards
  - Controlled data environments (e.g., Stats NZ IDI)
  - Use of synthetic datasets to reduce risk

## Summary

- Privacy laws regulate individual rights and organizational responsibilities.
- Māori data sovereignty emphasizes governance, consent, and tikanga.
- Data science research in Aotearoa must integrate both legal and ethical frameworks.
