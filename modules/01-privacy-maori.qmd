# Privacy Law and Māori Data Sovereignty

## Why Privacy Matters
- Protects personal information from misuse  
- Builds **trust** in research and institutions  
- For Māori, privacy links to **data sovereignty** (collective as well as individual rights)  
- Both a **legal requirement** and an **ethical obligation**  

---

## Legal Foundations in NZ
- **Privacy Act 2020** governs personal data  
- Replaced 1993 Act → updated for digital realities  
- Sets rules for collecting, storing, sharing, and using data  
- Applies to **all organisations** — govt, universities, businesses  

---

## Core Privacy Principles
- **Purpose limitation** → collect only for a clear reason  
- **Minimisation** → don’t over-collect  
- **Accuracy** → check before use  
- **Security** → protect against loss/misuse  
- **Access & correction** → people can see/correct their info  

---

## Obligations for Data Users
- Must **inform individuals** when collecting  
- Ensure **robust security safeguards**  
- Individuals can request access & corrections  
- Some research exemptions (e.g. de-identified data)  
- Oversight from the **Privacy Commissioner**  

---

## Implications for Research
- Balance **privacy** with **public good** outcomes  
- Health/social research → **ethics approval** + **Māori consultation**  
- **Synthetic data** + **XAI** reduce risks but keep insights  
- Privacy = **trust + equity**

## Māori Data Sovereignty — What It Means
- **Māori Data** = information about Māori people, communities, or resources  
- Includes:  
  • Data generated by Māori  
  • Data about Māori (collected externally)  
  • Data about Māori resources (land, language, environment)  
- Sovereignty = rights over **ownership, governance, and use**  

---

## Guiding Principles
- **Rangatiratanga** → authority over Māori data  
- **Kaitiakitanga** → guardianship & stewardship  
- **Manaakitanga** → respect, reciprocity, consent  

---

## Te Tiriti & Governance
- **Te Tiriti o Waitangi** underpins Māori rights  
- Governance requires Māori in decision-making roles  
- Control includes **where/how data is stored**  

---

## Challenges & Trade-offs
- Most Māori data sits in **non-Māori systems**  
- Limited resources for iwi/hapū to govern data  
- Tension: **open data vs. cultural restrictions (tapu)**  

---

## Implications for Researchers
- Projects must ensure **Māori participation & oversight**  
- Data infrastructures (e.g. IDI) should embed Māori governance  
- Future tools (synthetic data, protocols) must respect **Māori authority**
