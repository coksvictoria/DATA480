# Privacy, Ethics, and Data Sovereignty in Aotearoa Research

## Why Privacy, Ethics, and Data Sovereignty Matter

- Protects individuals and communities from **misuse and harm** in data practices.  
- **Ethics** ensures research is conducted with **respect, fairness, and informed consent**, safeguarding participants and relationships.  
- For **Māori**, privacy extends beyond individuals to **collective rights** — a foundation of **Māori Data Sovereignty** [@kukutai2023maori].  
- Upholding these principles is both a **legal duty** under the Privacy Act 2020 and an **ethical commitment** to **equity and responsibility** in research [@chamberlain2022future].  
- Builds **trust, integrity, and accountability** in research and institutions.

## Privacy Legal Foundations in Aotearoa New Zealand

- **Privacy Act 2020** governs how personal information is collected, used, and shared.  
- Replaced the 1993 Act to meet **digital and data-driven realities**.  
- Applies to **all organisations** — public and private.  
- Overseen by the **Office of the Privacy Commissioner**.  
- Establishes **13 Information Privacy Principles (IPPs)** guiding fair and lawful handling of personal data — from collection to access.

## Reflecting on the 13 IPPs
- The 13 IPPs form the **foundation of the Privacy Act 2020**.  
- They are largely **individual-centric** — focused on individual rights, not collective data control.  
- This raises key questions for Māori contexts:  Can privacy laws evolve to recognise **collective data sovereignty**?

## Māori Data Sovereignty — What It Means
- **Māori Data** = information about Māori people, communities, or resources  
- Includes:  
  • Data generated by Māori  
  • Data about Māori (collected externally)  
  • Data about Māori resources (land, language, environment)  
- Sovereignty = rights over **ownership, governance, and use**  

## Guiding Principles
- **Rangatiratanga** → authority over Māori data  
- **Kaitiakitanga** → guardianship & stewardship  
- **Manaakitanga** → respect, reciprocity, consent  

---

## Challenges & Trade-offs
- Most Māori data sits in **non-Māori systems**  
- Limited resources for iwi/hapū to govern data  
- Tension: **open data vs. cultural restrictions (tapu)**  

---

## Implications for Research

- Privacy = **trust + equity**  
- Balance **privacy** with **public good** outcomes  
- Health/social research → **ethics approval** + **Māori consultation**

- Future Work
  - Future data systems should **embed Māori Data Sovereignty principles** in their design and governance.  
  - Emerging tools that enhance privacy (e.g. **synthetic data**, new data protocols) must still **respect Māori authority and values**.
